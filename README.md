# PORTFOLIO
This repository showcases a collection of projects that blend low-level programming, digital design, and industrial automation. Each project demonstrates a different set of technical skills across embedded systems, hardware development, and control logic.

# 🛠️ Embedded Hardware Project Portfolio

Welcome to my embedded systems and hardware development portfolio. This repository contains three key projects that demonstrate my skills in low-level programming, digital circuit design, and industrial automation.

Each project represents a different area of embedded and control systems engineering:

- 🎮 A **Pac-Man game in VHDL**, fully implemented in hardware.
- 🕹️ A **mini arcade console for the MSP430**, coded in C.
- 🌿 A **PLC-based greenhouse automation system**, designed using Ladder Logic.

## 📁 Projects Overview

### 👾 Pac-Man in VHDL

**Description**:  
A hardware-based version of the classic Pac-Man game built entirely with VHDL. It features custom-designed logic for movement, ghost AI, game states, and VGA video output. No microcontroller or processor was used—just pure digital design.

- **Platform**: FPGA (Basys 3 / Nexys A7)
- **Language**: VHDL
- **Features**:
  - Finite state machines for player and enemy control
  - VGA synchronization and signal generation
  - Collision detection and game reset states
- **Skills**: Digital logic design, synchronous systems, FSMs, timing analysis
